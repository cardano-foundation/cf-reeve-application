/**
 * Carries publish results back the other way: the publisher raises {@link LedgerUpdatedEvent} after
 * submitting, and document_vault's {@code DocumentLedgerUpdateHandler} - which runs on the api service
 * - needs it to move a document out of MARK_DISPATCH.
 *
 * <p>Three consumers already existed for this topic (accounting_reporting_core, funding, reporting) but
 * none gated on document_vault, so in the split deployment a published document's status never
 * advanced: the event was produced on `publisher` and nothing on `api` was listening for it.
 *
 * <p>Its own group id. Sharing one with another listener would split the topic's partitions between
 * them instead of delivering every record to each - the defect FundingConsumer and
 * AccountingCoreKafkaConsumer currently share, and one not to repeat.
